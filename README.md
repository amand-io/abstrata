# Abstrata - A Rust-based CLI Code Editor with Autocomplete and Security

Abstrata is a command-line interface (CLI) code editor written in Rust that provides users with a secure and efficient way to write, edit, and run code. It features advanced autocomplete powered by a suffix array, secure file handling and transfer, syntax highlighting, version control integration, password manager integration, two-factor authentication, static code analysis, multi-user support, and secure code execution.

## Features

### Autocomplete

Abstrata features advanced autocomplete powered by a suffix array, allowing users to quickly search for all occurrences of a partial string and offer suggestions for completing the code. This feature saves time and helps catch syntax errors.

### Secure File Handling and Transfer

Abstrata ensures secure file handling and transfer, including file encryption at rest and the use of secure file transfer protocols such as SFTP and SSH. This feature protects sensitive or confidential information, such as login credentials or private keys.

### Syntax Highlighting

Abstrata features syntax highlighting, improving code readability and catching syntax errors. Users can choose from a range of syntax highlighting themes.

### Version Control Integration

Abstrata integrates with popular version control systems such as Git and SVN, allowing users to manage their code changes and history directly from the editor.

### Password Manager Integration

Abstrata integrates with password managers such as LastPass and KeePass, allowing users to securely store and access their login credentials directly from within the editor.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Abstrata supports two-factor authentication (2FA), adding an additional layer of security to the login process and protecting against password attacks.

### Static Code Analysis

Abstrata uses static code analysis to catch potential security vulnerabilities in the code being edited, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. This feature ensures that users can write secure code with minimal effort.

### Multi-User Support with User Authentication and Access Control

Abstrata provides multi-user support with user authentication and access control, allowing multiple users to work on the same codebase while maintaining security and privacy.

### Secure Code Execution

Abstrata allows users to run code directly from the editor, with secure code execution to prevent unauthorized access to system resources. This feature is especially useful for testing code snippets.

### Online Error Tracking

Abstrata provides online error tracking, allowing users to see errors in real-time and providing suggestions to fix them. This feature saves time and helps catch syntax errors.
